## red pill or blue pill?

there are two ways to use tinytouch on your computer: `HID` and `PIV/PAM` mode. read about how they work in the sections below.

each has its advantages, and we want to scare you a tiny bit so you actually do
your diligence and understand the security implications of such a device before
you decide whether you are willing to take on the risks:

| features | HID | PIV/PAM* |
| -- | -- | -- |
| keyboardless login | ✅ | ✅ |
| sudo prompts | ✅ | ✅ |
| apple TCC (privacy & security) | ✅ | ✅|
| general settings | ✅ | ❌ |
| keychain/apple passwords | ✅ | ❌ |
| everywhere your password is accepted (remote SSH sessions, etc) | ✅ | depends, but probably not |

| security | HID | PIV/PAM* |
| -- | -- | -- |
| fingerprint sensor <-> esp | 🔴 (unauth'ed UART) | 🔴 (unauth'ed UART) |
| esp <-> computer negotiation | 🟢 (shared-key mac/encryption) | 🔴 (plain usb ccid/apdu) |
| authentication | 🔴 (password typed over hid) | 🟢 (piv challenge/response) |

| attack | HID | PIV/PAM* |
| -- | -- | -- |
| sensor uart spoofing^ | yes | yes |
| wrong focused field | yes | no |
| malicious password field | yes | no |
| usb traffic sniffing | low impact (channel is encrypted/mac'ed) | can observe apdus, not piv private key |
| usb keylogger | can reveal password | cannot reveal key |
| usb command injection | reject bad macs/replays | device may receive apdus, but auth still needs fingerprint-gated key use |
| flash dumping (secure boot/flash encryption off) | shared-key exposable | piv key exposable |
| flash dumping (secure boot/flash encryption on) | shared-key non-exportable | piv key non-exportable |
| flash dumping (with secure element) | shared key non-exportable | piv key non-exportable |

*PIV/PAM always uses HID to deliver the mandatory PIV PIN, which we do not use.
authorization is still gated by your fingerprint. the PIV PIN is not your
password, and is not considered sensitive in our scenario.

^this is the major security issue with this device. since all authentication
happens inside the fingerprint sensor, and the sensor communicates with the esp
over unauthenticated uart, it can be easily spoofed. basic countermeasures
involve filling the insides of the device with black epoxy. a more proper fix
would be upgrading to a more secure fingerprint sensor.

### so... which pill, if any?
this depends on:

1. your security tolerance
2. your environment
3. current/future criminal background
4. family/roommate relations
5. technical skill set of family members/roommates

risks are low to begin with since every attack here requires *physical access* to
both the device and your mac.

so ask yourself: will your device ever leave your desk? can your roommates
perform a flash dump in half an hour? how about your family members? do they have
anything against you that would create a motive? are you wanted by any government
agency? are you protecting sensitive or classified information? are you using a
company device? would you be personally implicated if you leaked company secrets?

if the answer is yes to any of the above questions, i think the magic keyboard presents an excellent value at $149 and is worth the added security.

if the answer is no, chances are you will be fine with a slightly insecure method
of authentication. personally, i am happy with the red pill and love the
convenience of having it work everywhere.

### hid mode

in hid mode, the esp acts like a usb keyboard.

the mac helper keeps your real password encrypted and stored on your mac. this
way, an attacker cannot extract your password from the esp alone. the esp keeps a
shared pairing key. after a fingerprint match, the esp sends a signed request to
the helper, the helper checks it, encrypts the password for that one request, and
sends it back. the esp decrypts it in ram, types it, then wipes it.

this is why it works almost everywhere. it is also why it is scary: the final
step is still your real password being typed into whatever has focus.

to make it less bad, the esp never stores the password. requests use a nonce and
mac so old requests cannot just be replayed, and the helper only sends back an
encrypted one-time response. the password only exists on the esp briefly in ram.

### piv mode

in piv mode, the esp acts like a usb smart card.

macos sends normal piv commands over ccid. when macos needs authentication, it
asks the card to use the piv private key. the esp only allows that key operation
right after a fingerprint match.

macos also expects a piv pin, so the firmware has a tiny hid side path that types
the dummy pin `000000`. that pin is not your mac password. it is just there to
get through the macos piv prompt while the real authorization is the fingerprint
gate around the piv key.

this avoids typing your real password, but only works where macos accepts smart
cards, like login and `sudo` with pam.

## install

### red pill
use this if you just want the thing to type your password.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r software/macos-helper/requirements.txt

pairing_key="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
.venv/bin/python software/macos-helper/tinytouch_helper.py --set-pairing-key "$pairing_key"
.venv/bin/python software/macos-helper/tinytouch_helper.py --set-password 'your-password-here'

cp firmware/tiny_touch_keyboard/secrets.example.h firmware/tiny_touch_keyboard/secrets.h
```

edit `firmware/tiny_touch_keyboard/secrets.h` so it contains the same pairing
key bytes, then flash `firmware/tiny_touch_keyboard/tiny_touch_keyboard.ino`
with arduino ide.

board settings used here:

```text
usb cdc on boot: enabled
usb mode: usb-otg
```

run the helper:

```sh
.venv/bin/python software/macos-helper/tinytouch_helper.py
```

for launchd, edit paths in
`software/macos-helper/launchd/com.tinytouch.helper.plist`, then copy it to
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.

### blue pill

use this if you want the current better path. it exposes piv over ccid, plus hid
only for the dummy pin `000000`.

`main/secrets.h` needs the piv certs and private keys for slots `9a` and `9d`.

generate test keys:

```sh
cd firmware/tiny_touch_smartcard
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout piv_key_9a.pem -x509 -days 3650 -out piv_cert_9a.pem -subj "/CN=tinytouch piv auth/"
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout piv_key_9d.pem -x509 -days 3650 -out piv_cert_9d.pem -subj "/CN=tinytouch piv key management/"
cp main/secrets.example.h main/secrets.h
```

then paste:

- `piv_cert_9a.pem` into `PIV_CERT_9A_PEM`
- `piv_key_9a.pem` into `PIV_PRIVATE_KEY_9A_PEM`
- `piv_cert_9d.pem` into `PIV_CERT_9D_PEM`
- `piv_key_9d.pem` into `PIV_PRIVATE_KEY_9D_PEM`

build and flash:

```sh
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/cu.usbmodem101 flash
```

after flashing:

```sh
system_profiler SPSmartCardsDataType
sc_auth identities
sudo sc_auth pair -u "$USER" -h <auth-cert-hash>
```

to test sudo:

```sh
sudo -k
sudo -v
```

when macos asks for the pin, touch the sensor.

## hardware

| part | used here | notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| microcontroller | seeed studio esp32-s3 | needs native usb and hardware uart. secure boot + flash encryption strongly recommended |
| fingerprint sensor | zw101-style uart sensor | uses the common `0xef01` packet protocol |
| computer | macos | hid mode needs the helper. piv/pam mode needs macos smart card support |
| case | printed top/bottom stl | `hardware/case/case_top.stl` and `hardware/case/case_bottom.stl` |
| wiring/solder/etc | misc | whatever your build needs |

other esp32-s3 boards should work if the usb and uart pins are available. other
fingerprint sensors may work if they speak the same uart protocol. other
microcontroller families can work, but are not currently supported.

## wiring

the fingerprint sensor connects over uart to pins 6 and 7 for tx and rx.

the interrupt pin can be connected anywhere. in firmware, it is connected to pin
1.
